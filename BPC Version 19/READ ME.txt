The program will not run if you do have JAVA installed, so either use the javaSetup.exe/JDK that I provided or 
Google Java Download and install the latest version (https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk19-windows), 
once you've done so just double-click the program ^_^

IF THE PROGRAM HAS ANY BUGS OR PROBLEMS PLEASE REACH OUT TO ME ON TWITTER @KRISGFX

ABOUT ME

Hi, I'm Kris also known as KrisGFX.
Recently I started cash trading and it became tedious for me to have to open the CALCULATOR
every time I wanted to calculate how much to offer, i thought to myself, why not make a simple Java project,
which will calculate it for me.

I do not have lots of experience with Java but i need to learn it so i tried to the best of my ability.
I will eventually update it when i have more knowledge but for the time being, I HOPE IT WILL HELP YOU <3
